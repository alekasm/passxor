# passxor

passxor is a simple command-line based, xor-encryption password tool. Passwords are retrieved by being copied to the clipboard so they never have to be visually seen. The encryption prevents your password database from being cracked, and a simple security measure prevents brute-forcing. Note that this does not prevent a targetted memory attack, only the protection of the saved database file.
